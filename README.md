# treg
Sized tasks with queryable progress status and registry
## Information
Currently this is designed for a specific need I have in a project at my work.
Therefore it's quick and dirty for now. I will add documentation later.
You should ignore this crate for now (unless you want to use it, for some obscure reason).
